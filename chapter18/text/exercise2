There is a saying “You are what you eat”. It does not mean that if you eat carrots then you’ll be a carrot or you’ll be an apple if you eat apples. It means if you want to be healthy, you need to eat healthy food.
Then, what is a healthy diet?
Scientists（科学家） have done a lot of researches（研究） to find out the answer, and now they have got some. They say that our meals should include（包含） foods from each of the four groups: grains（谷物）, vegetables, fruit, milk products and meat. They also say that we should eat a lot of grains. But vegetables and fruit are also very important to our health. So we should eat plenty of vegetables and fruit every day. And we should eat a little fat and sugar. If we eat too much of them, then we will have a bad diet.
Now do you think your diet is healthy enough? If it isn’t, what are you waiting for? You should change your diet into a healthy one from now!
